This repository provides a beginner-friendly, hands-on introduction to **Gradient Boosting** and its real-world application to **electric vehicle (EV) battery life prediction**. We start with core concepts, build mathematical intuition using matrices, and implement everything using Python — both with Gradient Boosting and XGBoost — in a Google Colab notebook.

## 📌 What is Gradient Boosting?

Gradient Boosting is a machine learning technique that builds an ensemble of weak learners — typically decision trees — in a sequential manner, where each new tree learns from the residual errors of the previous ones. Over time, this dramatically improves model accuracy.

## 🔋 Why EV Battery Life?

Electric vehicle (EV) battery life prediction is a critical use case in sustainability and energy analytics. We use features like temperature, charge cycles, and battery age to predict how long a battery is likely to last.

## 🧠 Understanding Gradient Boosting with Matrices

To build true intuition, we walk through Gradient Boosting step-by-step using **matrix math**:
- Start with an average prediction.
- Compute residuals.
- Fit trees to residuals.
- Update predictions iteratively.

This mathematical view helps demystify how boosting really works under the hood.

## 💻 Python Implementation using scikit-learn

We implement the Gradient Boosting Regressor using `scikit-learn`. The workflow includes:
- Data preparation
- Model training
- Error analysis (MSE, RMSE, R²)
- Visualization

## 📂 Working with CSV Data

The dataset `synthetic_ev_battery_data.csv` is used in the notebook:
- Columns: Temperature, Battery Age, Charge Cycles
- Target: Battery Life (years)

We demonstrate how to load, preprocess, and use this data for prediction.

## 📊 Visualizing Results in Colab

Using **Google Colab**, we:
- Plot actual vs predicted battery life
- Visualize prediction accuracy
- Interpret model outputs interactively

## ⚡ Introducing XGBoost

We then explore **XGBoost**, a faster and more regularized version of Gradient Boosting. Features include:
- Gradient + Hessian-based optimization
- Built-in regularization
- Efficient tree building
- Better handling of missing data

## 📈 Model Comparison: Gradient Boosting vs XGBoost

Using the same EV dataset, we compare both models:
| Model              | MAE   | RMSE   | R²    |
|--------------------|--------|---------|--------|
| Gradient Boosting  | –      | 3541.33 | 0.99   |
| XGBoost            | 45.37  | 3407.65 | –      |

We discuss:
- Accuracy
- Model tuning
- Suitability for different data sizes
